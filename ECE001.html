<u><h1> Research objectives:-  </h1> </u>
<font size="6"  > <p> The opjectives of writing this research is to identify the operating system and it's multiple types and also to knew that without the operating system the user cannot use the computer </p> </font>
<u><h1> Abstract </h1></u>
<font size="6"> <p> In this research article , we will take about the operating system . in the beginning, we will talk about it's definition, or in a better sense, we will clarify what is the operating system and what its function is and how it is important to operate the computer and facilitate its use to the user in an effective way. Also we will talk about its different types and give examples for the most famous operating system . <p>     </font>
    <u><h1> Introduction </h1></u>
    <font size="6"> <p> A computer   system   can   be   divided  into   four components:   
      <ol> <li> 1-the hardware  : such as CPU, memory and I/O devices</li>
       <li>   the  operating  system : provides the means of proper use ofthe hardware in the operations of the computer system, it is similar to government</li>
       <li> the  application  programs :  solve the computing problems ofthe user, such as : compilers, database systems and web browsers</li>
        <li> the users : peoples, machine, or other computer </li></ol>
        An operating  system(OS) is  a set  of programs  
        that control   the execution of application programs 
        and act as an intermediary between 
        a  user  of  a  computer  and  the computer  hardware. OS is software  
         that manages the computer hardware as  well as providing an environment 
         for application programs to run. Examples of OS are:  
         <ul>
       <li> Windows</li>
       <li> Windows/NT</li>
       <li> OS/2 </li>
       <li> Mac OS</li>
         </ul> The abstract view of system components is <br/></p></font>
