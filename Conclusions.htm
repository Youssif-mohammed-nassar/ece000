    <u><h1> Conclusions </h1></u>
    <font size="6" ><p> After finishing our Research we can find that the operating system is very important  to use the computer and 
       <ul type="disc  "><li>  and it's main objectives is :-</li></ul>
       <ol  >
        <li> To make the computer system convenient and easy to use for the user.</li>
        <li> To use the computer hardware in an efficient way.</li>
        <li> To execute user programs and make solving user problems easier.</li>
      <ul type=" disc " ><li>  	and we find the types of the operating systems is</li></ul>
          <ul> 
      <li>  	Monoprogrammed /multiprogrammed </li>      
       <li> 	Single-terminal/multiterminal</li>
       <li> 	Single-user/multiuser</li>
        and the best type of the operating systems are multiprogrammed operating system
     <ul type="disc" ><li>  	.and with out operating system user cann't use his computer</li></ul>
