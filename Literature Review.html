        If we have any computer or any another device like mobile or tablet it consists of 
        <ol type="A" >
<li>hardware (like CPU and RAM and HARD DISK )</li>
<li>operating system</li>
<li>application programs</li>
    </ol>
And the user if he want to use the application and programs on the computer he must have 
An operating system  to transfer commands to the hardware. 
In a better sense the operating system is control the hardware and make us use easily the applications and programs which exist on the computer also operating system control the CPU (which is the brains of the computer and controls all function of the compute's components and processes all commands and instructions and make billions of tasks per second) , also OS control the RAM(  which stores the programs and data the computer is currently using and RAM is faster than other forms of storage and is erased when you turn off the computer so it is volatile storage) also OS controls the HARD DISK ( which is a high-speed and high-capacity device so is your computer's primary device for permanent storage of software an documents so it is non volatile storage device)…..atc   so generally the operating system is a set  of programs  that control  the execution of application programs and act as an intermediary between a  user  of  a  computer  and  the computer  hardware  and  make the computer system convenient and easy to use for the user and make us use the computer hardware in an efficient way and also  execute user programs and make solving user problems easier.                       


After we knew the operating system and it's jop we must knew that the operating system has many types and  When  classifying  current  operating  systems  one  can take  into  account  different  criteria,  derived  from the concepts introduced above. One possible classification is based on the following criteria, which can be combined: 
<ol type="a" >
<li>if the system can run at the same time one or more than one program,</li>
<li>if  it  supports  the  connection  from  a  single  terminal  or  from  more  than  one,  and  </li>
<li>whether  it supports a single user or can manage more than one user</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
<li>Monoprogrammed /multiprogrammed.</li>
They are also known as single-tasking/multitasking, terms that we will consider synonymous. In primitive operating systems, both monitors a were the first systems for personal computers, for example MS-DOS, the program should have ended to start the next program. These systems are called monoprogrammed (single-tasking). From 1965 there appeared the first multiprogrammed systems (OS/360, Multics). Today, almost all operating systems are multiprogrammed (multitasking).  In multiprogrammed systems, several programs run at the same time, i.e., Their executions are intertwined with time, which is considered to be simultaneous. They use the concept of process (or task) to designate a running program. As stated above, The motivation behind multiprogrammed was the need to improve processor utilization and, consequently, to run operation in a multiprogrammed system usually represent independent applications. Later multiprogramming has   been used to express synchronization in the same application, where a set of tasks cooperate in a coordinated manner.  For  example,  In a word processor, we can find a task responsible for reading and processing keyboard input,  Another task responsible for spell checking, a third task responsible for periodically saving changes...  A particular class of multiprogrammed 
operating systems is the multithreaded systems, Which allows synchronization to be expressed in the application more efficiently. The difference between a process and a thread (also called subprocess) is, for our purposes, very small, and we will not address it at this time.  Thus, multiprogramming means multiplexing the processor among processes, as explained above. Obviously, a multiprocessor system (a computer with multiple processors) enhances further the multiprogramming By allowing simultaneous execution of programs as well. This is known as multiprocessing, and the operating systems that control these systems are called multiprocessor operating systems. Although there    are significant differences in the implementation of a multiprocessor operating system with respect to a single-processor operating system, with respect to the functional vision of applications and users they hardly transcend.
<li>Single-terminal/multiterminal.</li>
An operating system ready to be connected simultaneously from different terminals is said to be multiterminal, Other than that it is said to be single-terminal. Time-sharing operating systems, such as UNIX, are multiterminal. An operating system designed for personal computers —MS-DOS, Windows 95/98— is, naturally, single-terminal.  It is noteworthy the case of Linux, a UNIX system for personal computers, Maintaining the multiterminal philosophy of UNIX through a set of virtual stations. Mac OS, also derived  from  Unix,  is another multiterminal example. It is clear that a multiterminal system must be somehow multiprogrammed: As we will see, it is common for each terminal (real or virtual) to have a related process managing the connection 
<li>Single-user/multiuser.</li>  
A multi-user system that is able to provide user authentication and includes policies for managing user accounts, 
Protecting access, and providing privacy and integrity to users. In the beginning monitor- based operating systems, shared by many users; this functionality was manually implemented by the system operator. The first operating systems for personal computers, such as MS-DOS, were single-user. The general purpose operating systems of today are multiuser.  Note that some personal systems, such as mobile phones, include some verification mechanism (usually a password), but lack of policies to protect accesses to system resources and user management; they simply authenticate the user, But in all respects single-user.
