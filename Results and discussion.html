    <u><h1>  Results and discussion </h1></u>
    <font size="6" ><p> From the above we find that the operating system is a set  of programs  that control  the execution of application programs and act as an intermediary between a  user  of  a  computer  and  the computer  hardware and operating system has many types can classified due to the following criteria, which can be combined:
        <ol>
       <li>  if the system can run at the same time one or more than one program,</li>
    <li>    if  it  supports  the  connection  from  a  single  terminal  or  from  more  than one, and</li>   
    <li>    whether  it supports a single user or can manage more than one user  </li>
    </ol>  
      And also we find that the  multiprogrammed  operating system is the best type and it frequently  used nowadays  because it is more effective than Monoprogrammed and do more than one task in the same time so today virtually  all  operating  systems  are  multiprogrammed
